Extraction of meaningful information from heterogenous and changing datasets in real-world data-centric applications requires achieving the complementary functionalities of \textit{ multimodal data integration and relevance matching, situationally-aware data recommendation}and \textit{uncertainty management in open-world}. My research goal is to understand how these functionalities can be achieved by designing interactive algorithms and robust systems that solve the problem of \textit{\textbf{situational knowledge on demand in open-world}} from multiple forms of information, regardless of whether presented as text, images, videos, audio, or other modalities.
