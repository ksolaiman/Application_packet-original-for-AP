Additionally, in \cite{wang2015}, we studied how much information can motion sensors from a smart watch leak about what the user is typing regardless of any training from the user. In \cite{villarrealvasquez2020confoc}, we studied a novel defensive technique against trojan attacks in face recognition applications, in which Deep Neural Networks are taught to disregard the stylistic information of the inputs and focus on their semantic information only to mitigate the effect of triggers during the classification.  
% without requiring any training from the user, and also under the (obvious) condition that the watch is only on the left hand./
