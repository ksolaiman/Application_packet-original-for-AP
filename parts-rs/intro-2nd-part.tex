My later works branched into developing 
scientific principles to \textit{quantify} and \textit{characterize novelty} (significant and unexpected events) \textit{in open-world domains}, while creating scalable and efficient AI systems that \textit{react to novelty }in those domains.
% scalable and efficient systems that can \textit{adapt to changing data patterns in open-world environment} - 
% \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\arabic*)]
%     \item Novelties in Domain or Data level,
%     \item Novelties in Semantic Concepts,
%     \item Novelties in Planning domain Environments.
% \end{enumerate*}

% My later research morphed into building robust and adaptable data management (includes the domain complexity for perception domain) and data integration systems mainly for perception domain (work w/ Alina focuses on perception domain).
