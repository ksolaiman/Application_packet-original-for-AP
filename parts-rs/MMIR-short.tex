\textbf{Data Integration:} 
Data integration from various sources to answer queries over a single view of the data to users, is confronted with a multitude of heterogeneity issues. These problems arise from differences in data attributes names that hold similar data \cite{solaiman2021applying, solaiman2022femmir}, communication problems, and variations in data schema and types \cite{solaiman2022open}. As data volume increases and the necessity to share existing data intensifies, data integration becomes more prevalent.

% To address the challenges of data integration in domain-specific applications, I propose three data integration approaches. 
% The first approach, EARS, delivers integrated query results over time using a mediation approach and schema mapping \cite{solaiman2021applying}. The second approach, FemmIR, learns co-ordinated graph representation of the data samples comprised of their semantic features to deliver approximate matches \cite{solaiman2022femmir}. The third approach, WesJeM, uses Contrastive Learning to embed data-objects and their semantic properties in a high-dimensional space using higher semantic features in a data sample as weak labels \cite{solaiman2022open}, allowing zero-shot similarity matching and data discovery of multimodal data in open-world environments.

% Streaming data over time can be used online to train the model.
