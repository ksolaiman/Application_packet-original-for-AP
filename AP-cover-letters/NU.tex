Being authored and published multiple papers in VLDB, SIGMOD, and IEEE, I am confident in my communication skills. During my tenure as a full-time lecturer, I had the experience of taking up to 18 credit hours per semester while instructing multiple classes and 
labs on various courses. My duties included delivering lectures, designing course materials, conducting labs, grading assignments, and providing advising. I have taught upper and lower-level undergraduate courses for multiple semesters including Programming Languages (Java, C/C++, Python), Databases, Data Structure and Algorithm, Graphics, Networking, and Software Engineering (web and mobile development). I also instructed in graduate-level courses at Purdue University including Data Communication and Networking, Simulation and Modeling, etc. 
% Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a specialization in Pattern Recognition, where I proposed a novel clustering algorithm for irregularly shaped datasets using a single hyperparameter.
Under my guidance, multiple undergraduates and Master's students worked on their independent research.
% and learned essential skills in developing practical solutions for real-world problems.  
% Mentoring students on capstone projects would allow me to collaborate with other faculty members and industry leaders.

% My experience in interdisciplinary research would require minimal effort from them, benefiting both the students and the research teams.
As a full time lecturer, I have served on dissertation, accreditation and administrative committees.
%
I have prior involvement in developing course materials and improving course curriculum.
%
% In my graduate classes, the students appreciated using tools like HotCRP or Perusall for teaching literature reviews or paper writing.
Furthermore, teaching post-covid has equipped me with the tools and skills, including course management and automatic-grading
software to teach online or in-person, e.g., Brightspace, Gradescope, HotCRP or Campuswire.


\paragraph{P4) The ability to contribute through teaching and/or service to the diversity, cultural sensitivity, and excellence of the academic community.}
\textit{\textbf{Inclusion.}}
During classroom communication, I actively handle the diversity in accents by understanding the difference, addressing the speaking, and actively listening in traditional and alternative methods.
I always create a safe and comfortable environment for all my students to learn and share their feedback and questions. In addition, I have actively engaged in promoting diversity and inclusion through international collaborations, mentoring, outreach, collaborative and growth-focused teaching, and socially impactful research. As a future faculty of \shortInstitutionName{}, I would continue my efforts through inclusive teaching environments, affinity group participation, outreach to younger generations and beyond borders, and involvement with groups and student development programs advancing diversity and inclusion in \shortInstitutionName{}.
% in terms of race, gender, religion, culture, etc. 
% (such as ADVANCE and CMASS).
% \paragraph{Demonstrated commitment to and/or experience in the use of inclusive teaching methodologies and approaches that will engage and inspire students from all racial, ethnic, and socio-economic groups to reach their maximum potential.
I have experience utilizing inclusive teaching methodologies and approaches that have inspired students from diverse backgrounds to realize their potential, 
% In the context of object-oriented programming, the course implemented a differentiated approach by dividing the class into two groups: those with prior programming experience and those without. By tailoring the curriculum and providing additional support from teaching assistants, all students were able to catch up and align their skills for future courses. 
for example, creating differentiated approach for lesser experienced students or allowing the students to choose their goals.
% Similarly, in the network programming class, we empowered students to choose their course project topics and the format of their final presentations based on their individual goals. This approach fostered a sense of autonomy and resulted in impressive outcomes for each group. 
As a teacher, I am wholeheartedly dedicated to applying these experiences to inspire students from all racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds to achieve their utmost potential.


%
\textbf{\textit{Teaching Philosophy:}}
As a teacher, I aim to develop self-motivation and critical thinking among my students. Recognizing that every student comes from a different background and culture, I always consider the interconnection between the student's current knowledge and learning capability while preparing the lectures. To promote learning by doing, I choose exercises that are both related to the core concepts and challenging so that they have to step outside of their comfort zone and can develop the logical thinking needed for solving research questions and real-life problems. Letting the students choose the modality for lectures and deliverables, giving frequent feedback for homework and projects, grading with a growth mindset, and leaving detailed reasoning are some of my efforts to make them feel autonomous and involved in the learning process. In my prospective career as \PositionName{}, I look forward to working in a collaborative teaching and learning environment with both faculty and students, where I can improve courses incorporating novel teaching  techniques, research, and the most recent theories on learning, such as self-determination theory, belongingness, etc. 


% \paragraph{curriculum development for lecture and lab courses in Computer Science/Data Science}
