Dear Members of the Search Committee:

I am writing to apply for the position of Interdisciplinary Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research faculty member at University of Missouri as part of the MizzouForward initiative.
I am a doctoral candidate at Purdue University, and I am scheduled to complete my Ph.D. in Computer Science by July 2023. My research has been funded by federal agencies and industry partners such as DARPA, Sandia and NGC. I have a strong interdisciplinary orientation in my work and have collaborated with end-users and experts in database, NLP+CV, informatics and data science, along with industry partners from MIT, NGC, USC, UMichigan, DARPA, and others. My research portfolio includes multiple publications in top data management venues such as VLDB, SIGMOD, AAAI, and IEEE and systems with societal impacts. With a teaching and research experience of more than six years, I believe I have the necessary skills to fulfill the duties of an Assistant Professor at University of Missouri.
 
% I was motivated to apply as I believe I can contribute to \shortInstitutionName{}'s mission of promoting intellectual pluralism and quality education with my commitment to pursue collaborative teaching, the experience of attending a multi-faceted public research university, and my focus on impactful research and education.  With a teaching and research experience of more than six years, I believe I have the necessary skills to fulfill the duties of an \PositionName{} for the University of Missouri Institute for Data Science and Informatics (MUIDSI). %at MU.
% As a Lecturer and teaching assistant in the CS program at Purdue University, I worked in a culturally, ethnically, and economically diverse and ever-evolving environment. This experience strengthened my communication, interpersonal, and organizational skills. 
% Managing large labs with the Undergraduate TAs or handling graduate labs on my own has allowed me to showcase my teamwork and adaptability skills. Teaching students from sophomore to graduate levels required continuous learning and flexibility to facilitate their progression and expectation from the courses. 

\paragraph{1 and P1) current research portfolio, accomplishments, and future research goals}
% \paragraph{1) Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science}
% I have completed my Master's degree requirements with systems, algorithms, and data-science-related courses, along with elective classes regarding current advancements in Database and Machine Learning. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a specialization in Pattern Recognition, where I proposed a novel clustering algorithm for irregularly shaped datasets using a single hyperparameter.
% For my Ph.D. dissertation, I propose a system for \textit{Multimodal data discovery} to deliver users with the relevant data at the right time. My proposed system includes solutions for processing large-scale multimodal data, feature extraction from perceptual and textual domains, cross-modal relevance matching, and real-time data delivery. I also proposed a framework for measuring domain complexity in distributed perception domains and a weakly supervised model for open-world cross-modal retrieval to accommodate systems with open-world novelty. I aim to continue my research on Open-world AI and Multimodal information retrieval to understand the hidden patterns in ever-increasing influx of cross-modal data.

I have experience developing algorithms and systems for retrieval and recommendation of multimodal information in open-world application domains, regardless of whether presented as text, images, videos, audio, or other modalities. My research focused on real applications of learning algorithms and foundations of artificial intelligence and machine learning for open-world novelties, with an emphasis on large-scale machine learning systems, deep learning, representation learning, planning agents, and feature-centered knowledge accumulation. My work with NGC and DARPA resulted in innovative research programs that made an impact in the field, including novel approaches to \textit{resource-aware data management, novel feature extraction methods, label-independent data integration,} and \textit{addressing open-world novelties}. My work in \textit{quantifying and characterizing novelty in open-world domains} had impacts and collaborations in planning domains and autonomous systems. I have successfully applied my work to address open societal problems, such as missing person search, dataset complexity estimation, and medical triage.

% I have worked on developing algorithms and robust systems to extract meaningful information from heterogeneous and changing datasets, regardless of whether presented as text, images, videos, audio, or other modalities. I also proposed scientific principles to \textit{quantify and characterize novelty in open-world domains, while creating scalable and efficient AI systems that react to novelty in those domains}. My research focused on three main challenges for multimodal information processing in open-world: \textit{resource-aware data management system, label-independent data integration, and dealing with open-world novelties}. I have developed several approaches to address these challenges, including SKOD for situational knowledge deliver, EARS for data integration using schema mapping, FemmIR for approximate matching of co-ordinated graph representations of data samples, HART for attribute extraction from text, and WesJeM for embedding data-objects and their semantic properties in a high-dimensional space using higher-level semantic features. My work has had a positive impact on open societal problems, including Missing Person Search, Dataset Complexity Estimation, and Medical Triage. 

My long-term goal is to create intelligent systems that can reason, learn and cooperate with humans to improve the standard of living by utilizing the 
% vast amounts of data available in the modern era 
modern-era data influx
and address real-world challenges.
To achieve this, I plan to continue my research on multimodal data management in open-world by focusing on \textit{user preference modeling, improving explainability and trustworthiness in data recommendation with validation and cross-checking, developing algorithms for privacy preserving data dissemeniation, and exploring theories on novelties in learning algorithms}. 
% You believe your research can make a significant impact on society by leveraging existing scientific advancements and addressing real-world challenges.
