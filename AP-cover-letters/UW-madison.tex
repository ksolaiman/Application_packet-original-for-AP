% education with my commitment to pursue collaborative teaching, the experience of attending a multi-faceted public research university, and my focus on impactful research and education.  
With a teaching and research experience of more than six years, I believe I have the necessary skills to fulfill the duties of an \PositionName{} for the \InstitutionName{}.

\paragraph{1 and P1) current research portfolio, accomplishments, and future research goals}
% \paragraph{1) Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science}
% I have completed my Master's degree requirements with systems, algorithms, and data-science-related courses, along with elective classes regarding current advancements in Database and Machine Learning. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a specialization in Pattern Recognition, where I proposed a novel clustering algorithm for irregularly shaped datasets using a single hyperparameter.
% For my Ph.D. dissertation, I propose a system for \textit{Multimodal data discovery} to deliver users with the relevant data at the right time. My proposed system includes solutions for processing large-scale multimodal data, feature extraction from perceptual and textual domains, cross-modal relevance matching, and real-time data delivery. I also proposed a framework for measuring domain complexity in distributed perception domains and a weakly supervised model for open-world cross-modal retrieval to accommodate systems with open-world novelty. I aim to continue my research on Open-world AI and Multimodal information retrieval to understand the hidden patterns in ever-increasing influx of cross-modal data.

%%%%% Just rudimentary level past research detail, didnot connect with application %%%
% I have worked on developing algorithms and robust systems to extract meaningful information from heterogeneous and changing datasets, regardless of whether presented as text, images, videos, audio, or other modalities. % , while achieving data-driven and resource-aware data management and data integration capabilities. 
% I also proposed scientific principles to \textit{quantify and characterize novelty in open-world domains, while creating scalable and efficient AI systems that react to novelty in those domains}. % My research focused on three main challenges for multimodal information processing in open-world: \textit{resource-aware data management system, label-independent data integration, and dealing with open-world novelties}. I have developed several approaches to address these challenges, including SKOD for situational knowledge deliver, EARS for data integration using schema mapping, FemmIR for approximate matching of co-ordinated graph representations of data samples, HART for attribute extraction from text, and WesJeM for embedding data-objects and their semantic properties in a high-dimensional space using higher-level semantic features. My work has had a positive impact on open societal problems, including Missing Person Search, Dataset Complexity Estimation, and Medical Triage. 

I have experience developing algorithms and systems for open-world application domains and retrieval and recommendation of multimodal data. 
My research focused on real applications of learning machines and foundations of artificial intelligence and machine learning for \textit{open-world novelties}, with an emphasis on large-scale machine learning systems, deep learning, representation learning, reinforcement learning, and explanability.

\paragraph{You should highlight your experience in teaching and mentoring students at different levels}
As a Lecturer for 2 years and teaching assistant in the CS program at Purdue University for 5 years, I worked in a culturally, ethnically, and economically diverse and ever-evolving environment. This experience strengthened my communication, interpersonal, and organizational skills. 
Leading large labs with the Undergraduate TAs or handling graduate labs on my own has allowed me to showcase my teamwork and adaptability skills. Teaching students from sophomore to graduate levels required continuous learning and flexibility to facilitate their progression and expectation from the courses.
% In my graduate classes, the students appreciated using tools like HotCRP or Perusall for teaching literature reviews or paper writing.
% Furthermore, teaching post-covid has equipped me with the tools and skills, including course management and automatic-grading software to teach online or in-person, e.g., Brightspace, Gradescope, or Campuswire.
%
\paragraph{Teaching Philosophy}
My teaching philosophy revolves around growing intrinsic motivation, autonomous identity and critical thinking among students, understanding the diversity among students, and leading with a growth mindset.
% As a teacher, I aim to develop self-motivation and critical thinking among my students. % Recognizing that every student comes from a different background and culture and finding the interconnection between the student's current knowledge and learning capability has helped me prepare better lectures. % To promote learning by doing, I choose exercises that are both related to the core concepts and challenging so that they have to step outside of their comfort zone and can develop the logical thinking needed for solving research questions and real-life problems. Letting the students choose the modality for lectures and deliverables, giving frequent feedback for homework and projects, grading with a growth mindset, and leaving detailed reasoning are some of my efforts to make them feel autonomous and involved in the learning process. 
\paragraph{4) Good communication skills.}
% I gained proficiency in delivering talks to large audiences through lectures in labs and classes and frequent presentations in review meetings and conferences with JPL, Northrop Grumman, and DARPA. Being authored and published multiple papers in VLDB, SIGMOD, and IEEE, I am confident in my communication skills. 

\paragraph{4) Teaching Experience of lot of credits.}
% As a full-time lecturer, I had the experience of taking upto 18 credit hours per semester while teaching multiple classes and labs on various courses. I have experience teaching programming language courses (Java, C/C++, Python), database courses (SQL), data structure and algorithm, and software engineering courses (JavaScript and PHP) for multiple semesters. 

\paragraph{curriculum development for lecture and lab courses in Computer Science/Data Science}
% I have prior involvement in developing course materials for \textit{Object-oriented programming, Databases,} and \textit{Simulation and Modeling}. In addition, during my tenure as a Lecturer, I improved the undergraduate curriculum for \textit{Network Programming} and \textit{Graphics}.
I have prior involvement in developing course materials (OOP, databases, simulation and modeling) and improving course curriculum.
% In my prospective career as \PositionName{}, 
I look forward to working in a collaborative teaching and learning environment with both faculty and students, where I can improve courses incorporating novel teaching  techniques, research discoveries, and the most recent theories on learning, such as Self-determination theory, belongingness, etc. 
I am excited to teach CS courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels. 
I would also welcome the opportunity to develop new courses according to the departmental needs.

\paragraph{interdiscipliniary colab}
% During research, I enjoyed working with our industry colleagues and understood the need for interdisciplinary collaborations between academia and industry. 
% This experience would be helpful for me to integrate with \shortInstitutionName{}'s mission of interdisciplinary collaboration to better the economic, social, cultural, and environmental health of the communities.
% among social justice, the health sector, and academia.

\paragraph{P4) The ability to contribute through teaching and/or service to the diversity, cultural sensitivity, and excellence of the academic community.}
\paragraph{Diversity}
I strongly believe in the value of diversity and inclusion and have actively worked to create an inclusive research and teaching environment. During classroom communication, I actively handle the diversity in accents by understanding the difference, addressing the speaking, and actively listening in traditional and alternative methods.
I always create a safe and comfortable environment for all my students to learn and share their feedback and questions. In addition, I have actively engaged in promoting diversity and inclusion through international collaborations, mentoring students from diverse backgrounds, outreach, and socially impactful research. Under my guidance, multiple undergraduates and Master's students worked in teams on same projects for independent research and learned essential skills in developing practical solutions for real-world problems. As a future faculty of \shortInstitutionName{}, I would continue my efforts through leading an equal-opportunity research group, creation of inclusive environments, affinity group participation, outreach to younger generations and beyond borders, and involvement with groups advancing diversity at \shortInstitutionName{}.
