<!-- l. 3 --><p class='indent'>   Real-world use-cases in data-centric applications (including societal, healthcare, or education) with minimal computational
resources often have an unprecedented influx of unstructured and noisy data from multiple sources and modalities. Extraction
of meaningful information from such heterogenous and changing datasets requires achieving the complementary functionalities
of  <span class='ptmri8t-'>cross-modal matching, scalable data management system (mostly search engines and databases), </span>and <span class='ptmri8t-'>situationally-aware
</span><span class='ptmri8t-'>data recommendation. </span>My research goal is to understand how these functionalities can be achieved by designing interactive
algorithms and robust systems that solve the problem of <span class='ptmb8t-'>situational knowledge on demand in open-world </span>from multiple
forms of information, regardless of whether presented as text, images, videos, audio, or other modalities, while
achieving data-driven and resource-aware <span class='ptmri8t-'>data management </span>and <span class='ptmri8t-'>data integration </span>capabilities.  My later works
branched into developing scientific principles to <span class='ptmri8t-'>quantify </span>and <span class='ptmri8t-'>characterize novelty </span>(significant and unexpected
events) <span class='ptmri8t-'>in open-world domains</span>, while creating scalable and efficient AI systems that <span class='ptmri8t-'>react to novelty </span>in those
domains.
</p><!-- l. 1 --><p class='indent'>   Developing intelligent AI systems including situational knowledge recommenders for open-world environments involves
tackling multiple <span class='ptmri8t-'>system design challenges</span>: </p>
<ul class='itemize1'>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmb8t-'>Resource-aware Data Management: </span>Data management systems require a comprehensive understanding of the data
properties, user requirements, and limitations imposed by open-world to achieve optimal performance and scalability
for multimodal data recommendation. Emerging multimodal applications impose challenges for traditional system
(hardware and software) design choices ranging all the way from input (heterogeneous sources, context and modalities)
and  output  (delivery-on-time,  quick  throughput  and  diverse  users),  changing  information  needs  (knowledge  base
creation and query), to computational resources (lack of annotations, domain-specific feature extractors or human
resources). For instance, we showed that transfer learning for fine-grained semantic concept extraction from videos
turned out to be ill-suited in large-scale systems <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmb8t-'>Data Integration: </span>Data integration from various sources to answer queries over a single view of the data to users,
is  confronted  with  a  multitude  of  heterogeneity  issues.  These  problems  arise  from  differences  in  data  attributes
names that hold similar data <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>, <span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, communication problems, and variations in data schema and types <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>. As data
volume increases and the necessity to share existing data intensifies, data integration becomes more prevalent. My
first approach for data integration, EARS, delivers integrated query results over time using a mediation approach and
schema mapping <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, solving the problem of scalability and quick throughput. The second approach, FemmIR, learns
a co-ordinated graph representation of the data samples comprised of their semantic features to deliver approximate
matches  <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>.  The  third  approach,  WesJeM,  uses  Contrastive  Learning  to  embed  data-objects  and  their  semantic
properties  in  a  high-dimensional  space  using  higher-level  semantic  features  in  a  data  sample  as  weak  labels  <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>,
allowing zero-shot similarity matching and data discovery of multimodal data in open-world environments.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmb8t-'>Dealing  with  Open-world  Novelties:  </span>To  construct  intelligent  AI  systems,  it  is  necessary  to  adapt  to  evolving
scenarios.  However,  conventional  AI  systems  face  restrictions  when  it  comes  to  managing  unexpected  events  or
"novelties" that were not previously seen or modeled. We need to characterize, detect and adapt to novelties at various
stages of the AI life cycle, such as data integration, relevance learning, environment modeling, feature extraction, and
inherent domain properties. Novelty characterization and difficulty estimation is required in a plethora of AI systems
ranging from multimodal information retrieval <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span> (distribution change and concept drift), dataset complexity <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, to
visual (object detection in video and image <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>) and planning domains (games <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span> and war). </li></ul>
<!-- l. 16 --><p class='indent'>   My work has shown positive results on open societal problems that previously required large-scale human endeavor and
computational resources, such as Missing Person Search <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, Dataset Complexity Estimation <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, Search and Rescue in
Disasters <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, and Medical Triage. The impacts of my work in academia span across diverse areas, including Multimodal
Information Retrieval, Data Discovery, Building Robust AI Agents, and Data Completion, thereby creating a significant
impact.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p><!-- l. 19 --><p class='indent'>   My research on Novelty Adaptation and Situational Knowledge Delivery has the capability to <span class='ptmb8t-'>transform information
</span><span class='ptmb8t-'>retrieval for everyone by empowering AI systems </span>to promptly and precisely retrieve the information required by users, even
in situations where the resources are minimal, data sources are in a state of constant change, and involve various modalities,
interconnections, and predictive arguments. This can have broad implications for a variety of applications with societal and
user-end impacts, including contextual search engines, digital libraries, AI-assisted journaling and mindfulness, urban
information system, etc.

</p><!-- l. 4 --><p class='indent'>   Currently, we are experiencing a thrilling era for multimodal information processing and robust AI research since it is
highly supported by the core programs in NSF’s Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) and by
"Harvesting the Data Revolution (<span class='zptmcm7m-'>HDR</span><sup><span class='zptmcm7t-x-x-74'>2</span></sup>)" idea - second wave of one of the 10 big ideas by NSF for long-term
research.
</p><!-- l. 11 --><p class='indent'>   My <span class='ptmb8t-'>long-term goal </span>is to create intelligent systems that can reason, learn and cooperate with humans to improve the
standard of living by utilizing the vast amounts of data available in the modern era. My focus is to devise new algorithms and
methods that can make a significant impact on society, leverage existing scientific advancements, and address real-world
challenges. To that end, I plan to continue my research on <span class='ptmri8t-'>multimodal data management in real world </span>by approaching from the
following directions:
</p>
<ul class='itemize1'>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmbi8t-'>User Preference Modeling: </span>To complete the life-cycle of <span class='ptmri8t-'>situational knowledge delivery</span>, we still have challenges in modeling
user’s information need in a robust and efficient manner in multiple directions <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>: <a id='x1-2r1'></a>(1) user requirement is not always obvious
or explicitly stated,<a id='x1-3r2'></a> (2) user can be interested in multiple types of events and knowledge bases with varying probabilities,<a id='x1-4r3'></a> (3) 
learning algorithms need to <span class='ptmri8t-'>adapt to changing user preferences with time</span>. I aim to develop novel algorithms
using techniques such as active learning and reinforcement learning that can accurately capture and predict
users’ preferences based on their behavior, interactions, and feedback. Understanding the features that drive user
preferences, and leveraging this knowledge to improve personalized recommendations and user experience, has
applications in education (student advising, classroom teaching), e-commerce, healthcare, etc. To achieve this research
goal, collaborations with researchers in  <span class='ptmb8t-'>human-computer interaction, psychology, and marketing </span>will be
essential.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmbi8t-'>Explainability and Trustworthiness in Data Recommendation. </span>As the amount of multimodal data generated and consumed by
users is increasing, there is a growing need for users to understand the basis for recommendations <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span> and the saliency and
trustworthiness of the information being consumed. This is especially important in sensitive domains such as <span class='ptmri8t-'>healthcare,
</span><span class='ptmri8t-'>finance, and legal decision-making </span>to allow for tracking, cross-checking with social contexts and verification. To achieve this
goal, collaboration across multiple areas is necessary, including <span class='ptmb8t-'>data science, natural language processing,
</span><span class='ptmb8t-'>computer vision, human-computer interaction, and ethics</span>. This collaboration can also lead to the <span class='ptmri8t-'>development of
</span><span class='ptmri8t-'>ethical guidelines and principles for designing trustworthy systems</span>, ensuring that users’ rights and privacy are
protected.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmbi8t-'>Privacy preserving Data Dissemination and Federated Learning. </span>To address the growing concern over data privacy,
particularly in medical and identity contexts, research in privacy-preserving multimodal data dissemination and federated
learning is crucial, as identified in SKOD framework <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>. Further research to integrate the use of local data processing and
remote federation with multimodal machine learning techniques is needed to ensure this new requirement in information
processing, while understanding and formalizing the resource requirements. Collaboration across various fields such as
<span class='ptmb8t-'>information security, statistics, data management, law, ethics, and public policy </span>is vital to advance research in this
area.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmbi8t-'>Information Completion and Data Democratization. </span>As data becomes increasingly important in all domains, there is a need
for new techniques that enable individuals and organizations to efficiently extract insights from data and complete missing
information. To address this challenge, future research should focus on developing advanced machine learning models that are
able to perform well even with incomplete data, as well as methods for effective data integration and knowledge transfer within
organizations. Collaboration is needed between <span class='ptmb8t-'>machine learning experts, data management specialists, and domain
</span><span class='ptmb8t-'>experts in various fields </span>to achieve a comprehensive and effective solution for data democratization and information
completion.

</p><!-- l. 5 --><p class='indent'>   I gained extensive expertise in overseeing and directing major projects, encompassing teams of over 12 individuals and
collaborating with various universities and institutions. I led multiple masters and undergraduate students, collaborated with
multiple Ph.D. students and coordinated with 5 professors from different universities to participate in the REALM project. I am
fortunate to have close collaborations with professors from multiple universities and research institutes, such as
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), University of Michigan (UMichigan), University of Southern
California (USC), Information Sciences Institute (ISI), Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), University of
Massachusetts (UMass), Middle East Technical University (METU), etc. I also have had the fortune to work closely with
researchers from databases and applications, along with end-users and program managers to conduct interdisciplinary
research. I intend to maintain my current collaborations while actively cultivating new partnerships to advance the
establishment of robust principles that underpin research in multimodal knowledge and novelty in learning
models.
</p><!-- l. 15 --><p class='indent'>   To realize my future research vision, I plan to collaborate with accomplished researchers from various disciplines, such as
natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, data mining, social science, human-computer interaction,
systems, and databases. This collaborative effort extends to WMU, where I anticipate collaborating with experts like Li Yang
(Data aggregation and Data embedding), Ajay Gupta (Decision making, Data Privacy, and Smart buildings), Guan Yue Hong,
Alvis Fong (Information Retrieval and Multimedia data), and others. With Li Yang, I can extend my work on Data Fusion and
Representation Learning. I can collaborate with Ajay Gupta on building explainable and robust decision-making agents and
privacy-preserving data dissemination. Guan Hong can work with me on intelligent systems and contextual reasoning-based
agents. I can complement Hong’s contributions with multimodal data processing and novelties in learning algorithms.
Additionally, I aim to establish connections with researchers from other institutions beyond WMU to advance the
establishment of robust principles that underpin research in multimodal knowledge and novelty in learning
models.
</p><!-- l. 27 --><p class='indent'>   During my Ph.D., my work has been mainly supported by the Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC),
DARPA, ARFL, and Sandia National Lab. Additionally, I have contributed significantly to the writing of grant
proposals, including idea generation, method design, idea illustration and visual aid creation, such as DARPA ITM
project, and DARPA Triage Challenge. For my future proposals at WMU, I will be designing them as clearly
articulated and doable projects with clearly formulated hypothesis and research questions, a definitive plan for
implementation and clear milestones. As a future faculty, I will continue to seek funding opportunities in the future from
early career supports, various funding agencies (e.g., DARPA, ARL, AFRL, IARPA, NSF, NIH, DOE, DOD)
and industries (e.g., NGC, Microsoft, IBM, Ford, Meta, Google, Intel) with collaborations from recognized
experts and colleagues from my research area. Specifically I will aim for NSF CAREER, CRII, EAGER, and
ADVANCE awards, OSR young investigator programs from DOE, DARPA, AFRL, NASA, and other research
awards.
</p><!-- l. 1 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='ptmbc8t-'>R<span class='small-caps'>ESEARCH</span> P<span class='small-caps'>HILOSOPHY</span>. </span>I believe that the ultimate objective of AI is not just to enhance performance on isolated tasks
but to complement human abilities in solving persistent issues in real world, minimize human labor through responsible action,
harness the power of data for our benefit, and make decisions that have long-lasting positive effects. My work is driven by a
desire to integrate these ideas into a context that prioritizes social good and encourages the consumption and
sharing of healthier information. This involves leveraging multimodal techniques to better understand complex
situations, adapting to different situations, and providing trustworthy and easily understandable information for
humans.
