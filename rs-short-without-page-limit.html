these functionalities can be achieved by designing interactive algorithms and robust systems that solve the problem of

<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmb8t-'>Multimodal Data Preparation, Data Completion, and Feature Extraction. </span>For data preparation and information
recommendation in modern multimodal applications, we proposed a novel multimodal knowledge querying framework
called <span class='ptmb8t-'>SKOD </span>(Situational Knowledge on Demand) <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>, <span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>. SKOD addressed the challenges imposed by heteregeneous
restful  and  streaming  input,  increasing  data  volume,  delivery-on-demand,  lack  of  computational  resources,  and
changing  information  needs  in  emerging  multimodal  applications,  by  leveraging  the  entity-centric  higher-level
semantic concepts and the functionalities of RDBMS. For satisfying an incomplete information need over time, we
used the Trigger functionality from Postgres after feature extraction and data integration. To tackle the challenges of
lack of annotations or task-specific feature extractors for unstructured texts, I proposed an attribute detection model
for text for the first time, <span class='ptmb8t-'>HART </span><span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span> using language representation models and syntactic properties of text. We also
proposed customizations <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span> for object detection models to account for on-demand video and image processing. We
developed SKOD during our collaborations with West Lafayette police department, MIT, and CMU for building a
Missing-person Query engine <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span> and a Human-in-the-Loop Video Querying system <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>. SKOD was demonstrated at
Northrop Grumman TechFest in 2019. The project has been funded by Northrop Grumman for three consecutive years
since 2019, renewing the funding every year.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmb8t-'>Data Integration and Relevance Learning. </span>Data integration from various sources to answer queries over a single
view  of  the  data  to  users  suffers  from  heterogeneity  issues  from  differences  in  feature  names  that  hold  similar
data  <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>, <span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>,  annotation  mismatch,  and  variations  in  data  schema  and  types  <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>.  As  data  volume  increases  and  the
necessity to share existing data intensifies, importance of data integration becomes more prevalent for multimodal
data  recommendation.  My  first  proposed  approach  for  data  integration,  <span class='ptmb8t-'>EARS</span>,  delivers  integrated  query  results
over time using a mediator approach along with Postgres triggers. A semantic mapping is employed between the
mediated schema and the data sources <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span> to query the limited properties-of-interest in real applications. The original
query-by-example  is  translated  into  conjunctive  queries  among  data  sources  and  a  SQL-Join  on  the  task-specific
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
features is performed at run-time to integrate all the relevant sources to the query example. The second approach,
<span class='ptmb8t-'>FemmIR</span>, learns a co-ordinated graph representation of the data samples from their semantic features to deliver a
ranked list of the relevant data samples to user queries <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>. I proposed a novel Edit distance metric, <span class='ptmri8t-'>CED</span>, to measure
the amount of difference between two data samples based on their semantic features. FemmIR learns an embedding
function  that  maps  the  features  extracted  from  the  input  data  sample  and  the  query  example  to  a  similarity  score
based on the multiplicative comparison of the Hierarchical Attributed Relational Graph representations (HARG) of the
features. The third approach, <span class='ptmb8t-'>WesJeM</span>, uses Contrastive Learning to embed data-samples and their semantic properties
in a high-dimensional space using higher-level semantic features in a data sample as weak labels <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, allowing zero-shot
similarity matching and data discovery of multimodal data in open-world environment.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmb8t-'>Uncertainty Management in AI Systems.  </span>AI systems are still limited in handling unexpected events or <span class='ptmri8t-'>novelties </span>that
are not part of their training data or well-defined environments. As part of the concerted effort of DARPA SAIL-ON,
I introduced techniques for characterizing and adapting to novelties at various stages of the AI life cycle, including
data integration, relevance learning, environment modeling, feature extraction, and training. Specifically, my research
explored novelties in multimodal information retrieval <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, object detection models <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, intrinsic domain complexity
estimation <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, and planning domain <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>. The proposed approaches aim to enhance the robustness and adaptability
of AI systems, enabling them to handle diverse real-world scenarios more effectively. <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span> characterized <span class='ptmb8t-'>novelties in
</span><span class='ptmb8t-'>multimodal information retrieval </span>for the first time in terms of distribution change and concept drift, and showed how
WesJeM can adapt to it. <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span> proposed an <span class='ptmb8t-'>intrinsic domain complexity measurement </span>for the distributed environment
using federated learning as the reference paradigm.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmb8t-'>Protection against Cyber Attacks and Secuity Leaks. </span>Additionally, in <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>, we studied how much information can
motion sensors from a smart watch leak about what the user is typing regardless of any training from the user. In <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>,
we studied a novel defensive technique against trojan attacks in face recognition applications, in which Deep Neural
Networks are taught to disregard the stylistic information of the inputs and focus on their semantic information only
to mitigate the effect of triggers during the classification. </li></ul>

to complement human abilities in solving persistent issues in real world, minimize human labor through responsible action,
harness the power of data for our benefit, and make decisions that have long-lasting positive effects. My work is driven by a
desire to integrate these ideas into a context that prioritizes social good and encourages the consumption and
sharing of healthier information. This involves leveraging multimodal techniques to better understand complex
situations, adapting to different situations, and providing trustworthy and easily understandable information for
humans.

</p><!-- l. 4 --><p class='noindent'>Currently, we are experiencing a thrilling era for multimodal information processing and robust AI research since it
is highly supported by the core programs in NSF’s Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) and
by "Harvesting the Data Revolution (<span class='zptmcm7m-'>HDR</span><sup><span class='zptmcm7t-x-x-74'>2</span></sup>)" - second wave of one of the 10 big ideas by NSF for long-term
research.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p><!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>My <span class='ptmb8t-'>long-term goal </span>is to create intelligent systems that can reason, learn and cooperate with humans to improve the standard of
living by utilizing the vast amounts of data available in the modern era. My focus is to devise new algorithms and methods that
can make a significant impact on society, leverage existing scientific advancements, and address real-world challenges. To that
end, I plan to continue my research on <span class='ptmri8t-'>multimodal data management in real world </span>by approaching from the following
directions:
</p>
<ul class='itemize1'>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmbi8t-'>User Preference Modeling. </span>To complete the life-cycle of <span class='ptmri8t-'>situational knowledge delivery</span>, we still have challenges in modeling
user’s information need in a robust and efficient manner in multiple directions <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>: <a id='x1-6r1'></a>(1) user requirement is not always obvious
or explicitly stated,<a id='x1-7r2'></a> (2) user can be interested in multiple types of events and knowledge bases with varying probabilities,<a id='x1-8r3'></a> (3) 
learning algorithms need to <span class='ptmri8t-'>adapt to changing user preferences with time</span>. I aim to develop novel algorithms
using techniques such as active learning and reinforcement learning that can accurately capture and predict
users’ preferences based on their behavior, interactions, and feedback. Understanding the features that drive user
preferences, and leveraging this knowledge to improve personalized recommendations and user experience, has
applications in education (student advising, classroom teaching), e-commerce, healthcare, etc. To achieve this research
goal, collaborations with researchers in  <span class='ptmb8t-'>human-computer interaction, psychology, and marketing </span>will be
essential.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmbi8t-'>Explainability and Trustworthiness in Data Recommendation. </span>As the amount of multimodal data generated and consumed by
users is increasing, there is a growing need for users to understand the basis for recommendations <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span> and the saliency and
trustworthiness of the information being consumed. This is especially important in sensitive domains such as <span class='ptmri8t-'>healthcare,
</span><span class='ptmri8t-'>finance, and legal decision-making </span>to allow for tracking, cross-checking with social contexts and verification. To achieve this
goal, collaboration across multiple areas is necessary, including <span class='ptmb8t-'>data science, natural language processing,
</span><span class='ptmb8t-'>computer vision, human-computer interaction, and ethics</span>. This collaboration can also lead to the <span class='ptmri8t-'>development of
</span><span class='ptmri8t-'>ethical guidelines and principles for designing trustworthy systems</span>, ensuring that users’ rights and privacy are
protected.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmbi8t-'>Privacy preserving Data Dissemination and Federated Learning. </span>To address the growing concern over data privacy,
particularly in medical and identity contexts, research in privacy-preserving multimodal data dissemination and federated
learning is crucial, as identified in SKOD framework <span class='cite'>[<span class='ptmb8t-'>?</span>]</span>. Further research to integrate the use of local data processing and
remote federation with multimodal machine learning techniques is needed to ensure this new requirement in information
processing, while understanding and formalizing the resource requirements. Collaboration across various fields such as
<span class='ptmb8t-'>information security, statistics, data management, law, ethics, and public policy </span>is vital to advance research in this
area.
</li>
<li class='itemize'><span class='ptmbi8t-'>Information Completion and Data Democratization. </span>As data becomes increasingly important in all domains, there is a need
for new techniques that enable individuals and organizations to efficiently extract insights from data and complete missing
information. To address this challenge, future research should focus on developing advanced machine learning models that are
able to perform well even with incomplete data, as well as methods for effective data integration and knowledge transfer within
organizations. Collaboration is needed between <span class='ptmb8t-'>machine learning experts, data management specialists, and domain
</span><span class='ptmb8t-'>experts in various fields </span>to achieve a comprehensive and effective solution for data democratization and information
completion.

(Data aggregation and Data embedding), Ajay Gupta (Decision making, Data Privacy, and Smart buildings), Guan Yue Hong,
Alvis Fong (Information Retrieval and Multimedia data), and others. With Li Yang, I can extend my work on Data Fusion and
Representation Learning. I can collaborate with Ajay Gupta on building explainable and robust decision-making agents and
privacy-preserving data dissemination. Guan Hong can work with me on intelligent systems and contextual reasoning-based
agents. I can complement Hong’s contributions with multimodal data processing and novelties in learning algorithms.
