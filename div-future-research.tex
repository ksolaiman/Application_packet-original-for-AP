% In the hiring process, unconscious bias happens when you form an opinion about candidates based solely on first impressions. Or, when you prefer one candidate over another simply because the first one seems like someone you’d easily hang out with outside of work.
% Affinity bias is unfortunately very common in recruitment, often resulting in unconscious racism and ageism. We often feel a natural affinity towards candidates we feel we have something in common with. For example, recruiters and hiring managers are often far more likely to hire an applicant who comes from the same town as them or share similar hobbies.
